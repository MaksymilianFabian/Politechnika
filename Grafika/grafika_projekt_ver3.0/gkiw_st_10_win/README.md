# Cyborg
Application created for the purpose of completing the Graphics and Data Visualization project. The application was developed using C++ and OpenGL. It features a simple 3D game where users can control a robot. To build this application, I utilized comprehensive knowledge in areas such as shader creation, animation, and textures.
